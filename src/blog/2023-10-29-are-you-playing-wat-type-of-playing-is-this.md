To fix the HTML code you provided, you should use JavaScript to dynamically get the current year and insert it into the <p> element. Here's an example of how to do it correctly:



html

Copy code

<p>© <span id="currentYear"></span> Company Name. All rights reserved.</p>



**<script>**

**  document.getElementById("currentYear").textContent = new Date().getF**ullYear();

</script>

In this code:



I added a <span> element with the id "currentYear" to represent where the current year will be inserted.

In the <script> element, I use document.getElementById("currentYear") to access the "currentYear" <span>.

I then set the text content of the "currentYear" <span> to the current year using new Date().getFullYear().
